          <h3>About</h3>

          <p>By day we are three professionals working in various sectors of
            the software industry in central North Carolina. By night we are
            Siramix, gathering in a basement and hammering away at our latest
            app. We are proud graduates from UNC Chapel Hill and are based out
            of Durham, NC.</p>

          <p>Siramix began when we decided to code a small game for Android in
            order to learn a bit about mobile programming. We felt that mobile
            games are too often looked at as an individual experience and wanted
            to create something that a whole group could enjoy. As we iterated
            on the idea and built in features we realized it was worth turning
            it into a fully featured game, and Buzzwords was born.</p>
