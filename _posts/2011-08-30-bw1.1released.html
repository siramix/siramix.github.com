<p>We've released a new version of Buzzwords and with it come some new features and bug fixes we'd like to let you know about.</p>
<ul><li><b>New Feature: </b>Added card review to Turn Results, allowing players to closely examine cards from<br />
  the previous Turn. While reviewing a card, the players may view a card's buzzwords and amend<br />
  the card's right, wrong, or skip status.</li>
<li><b>New Feature:  </b>Added gestures to the Turn screen, allowing users to mark a card Correct with a<br />
  swipe up (thumbs up), Wrong with a swipe down (thumbs down), Skip with swipe right,<br />
  and go back a card with swipe left.</li>
<li>Added card status icons that display as you mark cards during a Turn.</li>
<li>Polished the look of Turn Results and expanded row items to be more easily clickable.</li>
<li>Added sounds to many more actions such as pause / resume game.</li>
<li>Timer bar fixed to fill screen properly on high resolution devices (Xoom).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where duplicate cards were showing up on frequent turns.</li>
</ul>
